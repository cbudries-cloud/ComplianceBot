# Key Principles

All communications about (1) Truemed's services and (2) the eligibility of products for purchase using HSA/FSA funds must follow the following core principles: 

### **HSA/FSA Eligibility is Contingent, Never Guaranteed.**

Do not state or imply that a customer is automatically eligible to (a) receive a LMN or (b) use their HSA/FSA to purchase a product. Eligibility is determined by a licensed practitioner, who makes an independent determination of whether a specific medical condition necessitates the customer‚Äôs purchase. 

### **Eligibility Claims Must be Specific**.

Generally avoid broad eligibility claims about a merchant ("[Brand] is HSA/FSA eligible") or expansive categories of products that encompass both eligible and ineligible products ("Use your HSA/FSA on our bedding collection"). 

### **HSAs and FSAs Are For Medical Expenses Only**.

Purchases that generally improve a person‚Äôs health or wellbeing (including their mood, energy, recovery, and similar concepts) are not eligible for HSA/FSA. Only products that cure, treat, mitigate, or prevent a diagnosed medical condition are eligible. Make sure communication focus on the ways products address medical conditions.  

### **Tax Savings Claims Must Be Qualified and Explained.**

Any claims about the tax advantages of HSA/FSA purchases must be presented as approximate, and accompanied by an accessible disclosure explaining why HSA/FSAs are tax advantaged, that individuals‚Äô savings will vary, and how the savings can be approximated. Unsubstantiated or exaggerated claims are strictly prohibited.

### **Truemed is Not "Free."**

The costs of Truemed's services are included in the price that customers pay for products via Truemed. 

### **Don't Speak for Third Parties.**

Do not make statements on behalf of, or predict the decisions of, healthcare practitioners or third-party HSA/FSA plan administrators.

### **Be Precise.**

The nature of Truemed‚Äôs services, the roles of Truemed‚Äôs partner clinicians, and the documents involved must be described using precise terminology to avoid misrepresentations.

# Detailed Guidance

## 1. Mandated Terminology and Prohibited Phrases

Generally, within the bounds of this Truemed Brand Guide (Legal & Compliance), Truemed team members and merchant partners are encouraged to creatively promote Truemed‚Äôs services and HSA/FSA products. However, to ensure accuracy, in some cases Truemed requires or prohibits specific terminology. We do so where the use of colloquial or imprecise language creates material compliance risk.

- **Medical Professionals:** Avoid using generic terms like "doctor." Instead, use terms like "**practitioner**," "**clinician**," or "**healthcare provider.**" These phrases reflect that the reviewing professional may be a nurse practitioner (NP) or physicians assistant (PA) in addition to an MD or DO.
    - **Permissible:** "An independent licensed practitioner will review your clinical intake form."
    - **Prohibited:** "A doctor will approve your LMN."
    
    Where practicable, identify clinicians as being "independent" and "licensed" "partners" of Truemed. These are helpful clarifications, because they address common questions about Truemed‚Äôs partner clinicians. But neither ‚Äúindependent‚Äù nor ‚Äúlicensed‚Äù are required. 
    
- **Customer Submission:** The process a customer completes is to be referred to as a "**clinical intake form**," "**health survey**," ****or "**medical questionnaire**." ****Do not diminish the rigor of Truemed‚Äôs clinical intake form, including by describing it as ‚Äúquick‚Äù or ‚Äúbrief.‚Äù
    - **Permissible:** "Complete the health survey to determine if you qualify for a LMN."
    - **Prohibited:** "Just answer a few quick questions and a doctor will approve your LMN." (The term "quick" creates the inaccurate impression that the clinical intake form is not rigorous.)
- **Resulting Document:** If a practitioner approves the customer's need, the resulting document is a "**Letter of Medical Necessity (LMN)**."
    - **Permissible:** "If approved, you will receive a Letter of Medical Necessity."
    - **Prohibited:** "You'll get a doctor's note."
- **Customer's Condition:** Refer to the customer's reason for purchase as a "**health condition**" or "**medical condition**."
    - **Permissible:** "This item may be eligible when used for a specific health condition."
    - **Prohibited:** "This product is for your health and wellness journey." (General wellness is typically not a qualifying expense.)
- **Payment for Truemed's Services**: Explain that the cost of Truemed's services are ‚Äú**included in the price**‚Äù of the HSA/FSA eligible products. Do not suggest that Truemed's services are free to the customer, or paid-for by anyone other than the customer.
    - **Permissible:** "The cost of Truemed's services are included in your purchase price."
    - **Prohibited:** "Truemed is free for all [Merchant] customers."
    - **Prohibited**:  "[Merchant] covers the cost of Truemed for qualified customers."
    
    <aside>
    üí°
    
    **Rationale**: in the United States, a core principle of our healthcare system is that individuals pay for their own care, whether directly or through healthcare benefits made available through their employer. It could create compliance issues under state or federal law if Truemed or the applicable merchant paid for a customer‚Äôs healthcare services.
    
    </aside>
    
- **Medical Applications, Not Health and Wellness**: Explain the benefits of Truemed-eligible products in terms of diagnosing, curing, treating, mitigating, or preventing specific, diagnosed medical conditions. Products that contribute to general improvements in health, wellness, energy, mood, general appearance or other non-clinical considerations are not eligible for HSAs or FSAs.
    - **Permissible:** "[Product] is an effective way to manage chronic health conditions like diabetes, obesity, and hypertension."
    - **Prohibited:**  "Look radiant and feel energized by incorporating [Product] into your daily workout routine."

## 2. Communicating Eligibility and Product Scope

Statements regarding product eligibility should include appropriate qualifications about individual and product eligibility  be appropriately qualified. The scope of eligibility should be tailored to specific eligible products, or narrow product categories. (An exception applies if all, or nearly all, of a merchant's products are HSA/FSA eligible.) And eligibility claims should generally include that LMNs are required for HSA/FSA eligibility.

### A. Framing Eligibility

Language must clearly articulate that eligibility is not a certainty.

- **Permissible Framing:** This language correctly positions eligibility as conditional.
    - "HSA/FSA eligible with a Truemed LMN."
    - "You may be eligible to pay with HSA/FSA."
    - "Qualified customers can use HSA/FSA funds for eligible items."
    - "This item may be HSA/FSA-eligible when used to address a specific health condition. Complete Truemed's health survey to see if you qualify."
- **Prohibited Framing:** This language creates unacceptable risk by implying automatic or guaranteed approval.
    - "Use your HSA/FSA dollars."
    - "Your purchase is now HSA/FSA eligible with Truemed."
    - "We're eligible for payment from HSA/FSA providers."

### B. Product-Level vs. Category-Level Claims

Marketing claims about product eligibility should be made narrowly to avoid overstating eligibility. Claims about eligibilty for broad categories of products, or about merchants, create a high risk of misrepresentation if a merchant sells (or a category includes) both eligible and ineligible items. Assertions about product eligibility should instead apply to specific products or specific product categories. An exception to this requirement applies where all, or nearly all, of a merchant‚Äôs products are HSA/FSA eligible. 

- **Permissible Application (Single SKU Page):**
    - A clear statement such as "HSA/FSA eligible with a Truemed LMN."
- **Permissible Application (Mixed Category Page):**
    - A banner stating,  "HSA/FSA Some products may qualify for HSA/FSA plans with a Truemed LMN. Look for the Truemed logo on product pages."
- **Prohibited Application (Blanket Category Claim):**
    - "Use your HSA/FSA on our bedding collection." (This is prohibited because some items in a bedding collection, like purely cosmetic pillows, are likely ineligible.)
    - "[Brand Name] is HSA/FSA approved." (Except for the exception below, brands are not approved; only specific products for specific uses are, for qualified customers.)
- **Exception for Merchants With Only Eligible Products:**
    - Where all, or nearly all, of a merchant's products are HSA/FSA eligible with a LMN, they can make broader claims, such as: **  "Our products are HSA/FSA eligible with a letter of medical necessity."  or  "[Brand Name] now accepts HSA/FSA for qualified customers."

## 3. Representation of Consumer Tax Savings

Claims about tax savings are a focal point for regulatory scrutiny. All such claims must be conservative, accurate, and properly qualified.

- **The Standard:** Savings must be presented as an approximate figure and be explicitly linked to additional qualification and explanation. The basis for the calculation (i.e., tax savings) should be transparent where possible.
    - **Permissible:**  "Customers who qualify save ~30%*."  **"* On average, approximately 30% of gross income is paid to state and federal income and payroll taxes. Individual tax rates and state regulations vary. To see your estimated savings, checkout the TrueSavings Estimator at¬†http://truemed.com/savings-estimator." **
    - **Permissible (with additional context):** "When you qualify to use HSA/FSA funds, you can save about ~30%, depending on your individual tax bracket and your state's regulations."
    - **Prohibited Claims:** Exaggerated, guaranteed, or unsubstantiated savings claims are strictly forbidden. The phrase "up to" should be avoided.
        - "Save up to 40%."
        - "Save 30% now!"
        - "Your HSA/FSA unlocks 30% savings on products you were going to purcahse anyway."

<aside>
üí°

**Rationale:** The actual tax benefit to a consumer varies significantly based on the type of plan they have, their federal and state tax brackets, and the specific tax regulations of their state. Making specific, unqualified claims creates a risk of falsely advertising to customers who cannot achieve the advertised level of savings. Claiming a specific or maximum ("up to") savings amount is deceptive if that amount is not achievable by a significant portion of the audience.

# Pre-Publication Compliance Checklist

Prior to publication, all marketing copy (including emails, social media posts, website copy, and ad creative) must be audited against the following criteria. The copy may not be published if it fails to meet any of these standards.

### 1. Does the copy use conditional language?

The marketing asset must treat eligibility as contingent on the product, the customer‚Äôs circumstances  as a possibility that requires a Letter of Medical Necessity (LMN).

- Pass: Look for phrases like "HSA/FSA eligible with a Truemed LMN," "may be eligible," or "if you qualify."
- Fail: Red flags are absolute terms like "is eligible," "is approved," or "guaranteed approval."

---

### 2. Are savings claims approximate and explained?

Savings must be presented as an approximate ("~") figure and be accompanied by the mandated disclosure (*).

- Pass: Uses "save ~30%*" and includes the full, required disclosure explaining how savings are calculated: "* On average, approximately 30% of gross income is paid to state and federal income and payroll taxes. Individual tax rates and state regulations vary. To see your estimated savings, checkout the TrueSavings Estimator at¬†http://truemed.com/savings-estimator."
- Fail: Red flags are prohibited phrases like "save up to 40%", "save 30% now!", or making a percentage claim without the full disclosure.

---

### 3. Is the scope of eligibility specific?

Claims must be tied to specific products, not broad categories, unless the merchant meets the exception criteria.

- Pass: Uses "HSA/FSA eligible with a Truemed LMN" or "select items may be eligible"
    - For merchants where nearly all products qualify, broader claims like "Our products are HSA/FSA eligible with a letter of medical necessity" are acceptable.
- Fail: Red flags are blanket statements like "all bedding is HSA eligible" or "[Brand] is HSA approved" for mixed-eligibility merchants.

---

### 4. Does the copy use precise terminology?

The language must be accurate, precise, and not diminish or disparage the services provided by Truemed or its partner clinicians.

- Pass:
    - "practitioner"
    - "clinician"
    - "independent licensed..."
    - "clinical intake form"
    - "health survey"
    - "qualified customers"
    - "eligible customers"
    - "customers who qualify"
- Fail: Red flags are imprecise terms like "doctor", "doctor's note", or "quick survey".

This guidance does not restrict use of adjectives and other modifiers, so long as they are accurate and otherwise consistent with these guidelines. For example, it is okay to refer to Truemed‚Äôs "seamless health survey".  

---

### 5. Does the copy avoid third-party guarantees?

We cannot make promises on behalf of practitioners or plan administrators.

- Pass: The language correctly focuses on our process and the customer's potential eligibility.
- Fail: Red flags are any statements that predict an outcome, such as "your LMN will be approved" or "your HSA/FSA plan will reimburse you".

---

### 6. Is the copy focused on medical benefits?

The copy must connect the product to treating or preventing a medical condition, not general wellness.

- Pass: The language describes how a product helps "manage chronic health conditions like diabetes, obesity and hypertension".
- Fail: Red flags are vague, non-clinical words or claims like "wellness",  "look radiant and feel energized" or hype words like "instant" and "guaranteed".

---

### 7. Does the copy avoid implying that Truemed is free?

The copy must not imply that anyone other than the customer paid for Truemed‚Äôs services. 

- Pass: The copy states: "There is no additional cost to use Truemed, because the cost of Truemed's services are included in the purchase price"  or "Truemed‚Äôs costs are built into the purchase price, so you do not have to pay extra to use Truemed."
- Fail: The copy states "Truemed is free to [Brand] customers" or "[Brand] makes Truemed‚Äôs services available at no charge".

# FAQs

**1. Can an advertisement about HSA/FSA eligibility run without any qualifications?**

No. Advertisements that mention brand or product eligibility **must not** be run without appropriate qualifications, including that an LMN is required and not all customers qualify.

---

**2. Is it acceptable for a brand to claim "We are HSA/FSA eligible" or "[Brand Name] is eligible"?**

No, this is prohibited. Eligibility claims must be made about **specific products**, not the merchant or brand itself. 

---

**3. How should we refer to the clinicians who review eligibility?**

They must be referred to as independent practitioners. Using possessive terms like "our licensed providers" is prohibited. Truemed does not control the clinicians, who operate independently and exercise their own judgment. Implying that Truemed controls the clinicians could create legal issues under the corporate practice of medicine doctrine.

---

**4. Do eligibility claims always have to be at the individual SKU level?**

Not strictly, but claims must remain narrow and product-focused. The only exception for broader claims is for merchants where all or nearly all of their products are eligible.

---

**5. If we use a phrase like "HSA/FSA funds now accepted," is a disclaimer required?**

Yes. This phrase must always be accompanied by a qualifier, such as "for qualified customers."

---

**6. Is it mandatory to include a disclaimer that the plan administrator (TPA) has the final say on claims?**

While not strictly mandatory, including a disclaimer like "check your plan details before purchase" is considered a helpful best practice.

---

**7. Should we avoid using the term "intake form" in our communications?**

Yes, you should avoid vague or generic terms. You must use the precise, approved terminology, such as "clinical intake form" or "health survey," to accurately describe the process.

---

**8. What can we say about the turnaround time for an LMN review?**

Avoid vague assurances like "quick." You may only make specific time-based claims (e.g., "most customers hear back within 24 hours") if that claim can be substantiated with data for a substantial majority of customers.

---

**9. Can a brand comment on the likelihood or chances of a customer being approved for an LMN?**

No. You must never state or imply the odds of approval. Phrases like "chances are, yes!" are  prohibited.

---

**10. Can we say "apply to Truemed"?**

Never use the phrase "apply to Truemed." The correct approach is to encourage customers to use their existing HSA/FSA benefits to help manage their health conditions. The call to action is about using their benefits, not applying for a service.
